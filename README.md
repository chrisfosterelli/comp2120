Notes
-----

On Seminar 7, marks were deducted because my Animal classes did not contain toString methods. On a side note, the remove algorithim didn't work (but this wasn't noticed). Both of these issues are fixed in later commits.

On Seminar 9, passing an index(s) would allow the problems to be solved with signifigantly less memory. It isn't an issue for the scope of the class, but in extremely large datasets this would be inefficient.
